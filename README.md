# reinforcement-learning-algorithms

An implementation of 4 reinforcement learning algorithms in Python:

    On-Policy First-Visit Monte-Carlo Control
    Sarsa
    Q-Learning
    Dyna Q+

This was implemented as part of a racetrack environment provided for a university coursework, where the objective of the coursework was to train an agent to reach the end of a racetrack in as few moves as possible.

I can't provide the auxillary code required for the environment to function properly, as it is not my work. Instead, this is intended as a representation of my experience with Python, code quality, and ability to convert algorithms into functioning code.
